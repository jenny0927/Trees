                    Taxus baccata is a conifer native to western, central and southern Europe, northwest Africa, northern Iran and 
                    southwest Asia.[2] It is the tree originally known as yew, though with other related trees becoming known,
                    it may now be known as English yew,[3] or European yew. t is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, growing 10–20 metres (33–66 ft)
                    (exceptionally up to 28 metres (92 ft)) tall, with a trunk up to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) (exceptionally 4 metres (13 ft)) diameter.
                    The bark is thin, scaly brown, coming off in small flakes aligned with the stem. The leaves are flat, dark green, 1–4 centimetres 
                    (0.39–1.57 in) long and 2–3 millimetres (0.079–0.118 in) broad, arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to 
                    align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem, except on erect leading shoots where the spiral arrangement is more obvious. The leaves are poisonous.
